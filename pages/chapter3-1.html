          <p>
            Backing up refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium
            (disk, tape, flash drive, etc.) in case of a problem with the main
            secondary storage device. Backing up files and data on a regular basis
             is seen as a good computing practice and many computer systes can be
             set to back up files automatically on a regular basis. An example
             would be the use of magnetic tapes to back up internet servers on
             a regular basis, or cloud storage compaines using magnetic tape
             or hard disk drives to back up clients' data on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The backups are often stored in a different place to the main storage.
            This is in case of fire or some other situation that could lead to
            irretrievable loss of key data/files.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 id="1.1">Why back up data?</h4>
          <p>
            There are various reasons why backups are made. Some of the more
            common reasons are considered below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To saveguard against loss of data due to the failur of the orginal
              secondary storage device; this could be due to hardware failure
              (e.g. head crash on a hard drive unit),  problems caused by files
              being overwritten accidentally (or otherwise) or possible corruption
              of files (for example, caused by power surges).
            </li>
            <li>
              To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their
              intention (they may only want to gain access to the infomation for
              other purposes, for example to find personal infolation such as bank
               account details). However, the very act of hacking into files
               could cause problems such as corruption or data loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere;
              this protects the orginal against possible corruption or loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect of a virus. The
              virus could attach itself to the files, which could mean that the
              backups are also affected. If the computer was 'cleaned' of the
              virus and then the backup files reloaded, there is a real risk that
              the vrius could infect the computer system again. The best protection
              is not to get a virus in the first place.
            </li>
          </ul>
