        <h2>Optical storage media</h2>
        <h3>CD/DVD disks</h3>
        <p>
          CDs and DVDS are described as optical storage devices. Laser light
          is used to read data and to write data on the surface of the disk.
          Both CDs and DVDS use a this layer of metal alloy or light-sensitive
          organic dye to store the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          As can be seen from the diagram, they use a single spiral track that
          runs from the center of the disk to the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data is stored in 'pits' and 'bumps' on the spiral track. A red
          laser is used to read and write the data. CDs and DVDs can be
          designated as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>R - write once only</li>
          <li>ROM - can only be read</li>
          <li>RW - can be written to or read from many times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DVD technology is slightly different to that used in CDs. One of the
          main differences is the use of dual-layering, which considerablely
          increades the storage capacity. Basiclly, this means that there are
          two individual recording layers, The two layers of a standard DVD
          are joined togather with a transparent (polycarbonate) spacer; a
          very thin reflector is also sandwiched between the two laybers.
          Reading and writing of the second layber is done by a read laser
          focusing at a fraction of a milimetre difference compared to the
          first layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard, single-layer DVDs still have a larger storage capacity
          than CDs because the 'pit' size and track width are bother smaller.
          This means that more data can be stored on the DVD surface. DVDs use
          lasers with a wavelength of 650 nanometres; CDs use lasers with a
          wavelength of 780 nanometres. The shorter the wavelength of the
          laser light, the greater the storage capacity of the medium.
        </p>
        <h3>CD-ROM and DVD-ROM</h3>
        <p>
          These optical disks are read-only memory (ROM), which means they
          cannot be written over and can only be read. The data is sotred as a
          series of pits (equivalent to a binary value of 1) and land )
          equivalent to the binary value of 0) in the metallic optical layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'pits' and 'lands' are read by a low-powered laser beam that
          follows the data stream and reads from the centre outwards in a
          spiral. The light reflects differently off a 'pit' than it does off a
          'land' and this is interpreted as 1s and 0s (that is, data) - hence
          the term digital media.
        </p>
        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            CD-ROMs are used to store music files, software, computer games
            and reference software (such as an encyclopaedia).
          </li>
          <li>
            DVD-ROMs have much larger storage and are used to store films,
            computer data and ever-more sophisticated computer/arcade games.
          </li>
          <li>
            CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs are used in applications where there is a
            real need to prevent the deletion or overwriting of important
            data.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They hold far more data than floppy disks (one CD/DVD could
            replace several floppy disks in some applications).
          </li>
          <li>They are less expensive than hard disk drive systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The data transfer rate/data access time is slower than for hard
            disks
          </li>
        </ol>
