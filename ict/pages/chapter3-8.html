      <h1>Chapter 3: Storage Devices and Media</h1>


      <div>
        <h2>Optical storage media - continued</h2>
        <h3 id="CD-RW">CD-RW and DVD-RW</h3>
        <p>
          The RW means these disks are a rewritable media and can be written
          over several times. Unlike CD-R/DVD-R, they don't become ROMS. THe
          recording layer uses a special phrase-changing metal alloy (often
          GeSbTE [Germanium-Antimony-Terbium alloy]; a number of different
          methods are used to produce these alloys). The alloy can switch
          between crysstalline phase and amorphous phase (non-crystalline),
          thus changing inpus reflectivity to light depending on the laser beam
          power. Spots are produced that can be read by a laser and then
          interpreted as 1s and 0s. The system allows data to be written,
          erased and rewritten many times.
        </p>
        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Used to record television programmes (like a video recorder),
            which can be recorded over time and time again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not as wasteful as R format as more files/data can be added to at a
            later stage (with CD-R/DVD-R it is only possible to do a write
            operation once if you have already finalised the disc).
          </li>
          <li>Used in CCTV systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvabtages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Can be relatively expensive.</li>
          <li>It is possible to accidentally overwrite data</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="DVD-RAM">DVD-RAM</h3>
        <p>
          DVD-RAM uses a very different technology to CDs and DVDs. They have
          the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Instead of a single, spiral track, they use a number of concentric
            tracks
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of concentric tracks allows simultaneous read and write
            operations to take place
          </li>
          <li>
            They allow numerous read and write operations (up to 100 times)
            and have greate longevity (over 30 years), which makes them ideal
            for archiving.
          </li>
          <li>DVD-RAMs can be written to and read from many times.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          The recording layer is made from a similar phase-changing materal as
          used in RW technology. When writing, a laser heats the phase-changing
          alloy on the disk to about 500°C to 700°C, changing the reflective
          properties from shiny to dull (i.e. pits). If the disk needs to be
          erased, a laser heats the surface to about 200°C to return the disk
          to its original shiny state. A low-power laser is used to read the
          written marks on the surface. The shiny and dull marks ('pits')
          represent data to a computer where they are interpreted.
        </p>
        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In recording devices such as satelite receivers to allow
            simultanous recording and playback.
          </li>
          <li>Used in camcorders to store movies.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>They have a long life (estimated 20 years minimum life).</li>
          <li>
            It is possible to do a rewrite operation over 100 000 times
            (compare this to the RW formate, which only allows about 1000
            rewrites).
          </li>
          <li>
            Writing on the DVD-RAMs is very reliable - they have in-built
            verification software, so the accuracy of the data is ensured.
          </li>
          <li>Very fast access if the files are fairly small.</li>
          <li>No need to finalise the disk.</li>
          <li>
            Very large capacity (about 10 GB if double-sided format is used).
          </li>
          <li>
            They offer the ability to read data at the same time as data is
            being written.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Not as compactible as R or RW formatel many systems won't recognise
            the DVD-RAM formate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Relatively expensive (about four times the cost of a DVD-RW disk).
          </li>
          <li>
            They have been superseded by newter technologies such as solid
            state memories
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="Blu-ray">Blu-ray discs</h3>
        <p>
          Blu-ray discs are another example of optical storage media. However,
          they are fundamentally different to DVDs in their construction and in
          the way they carry out read-write operations.
        </p>
        <p>The main differences are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A blue laser, rather than a red laser, is used to carry out read
            and write operationsl the wavelength of blue light is only 405
            nanometers (compared to 650 nanometers for red light).
          </li>
          <li>
            Using blue lase light means that the 'pits' and 'bumps' can be much
            smaller, consequently, Blu-ray can store up to file times more data
            than a normal DVD.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blu-ray uses a single 1.1mm-thick polycarbonate disk; normal DVDs
            use a sandwich of two 0.6mm thick disks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using two sandwich layers can cause birefringence (light is
            refracted into two seprate separte beams causing reading errors);
            because Blu-ray uses only one layer, the disks don't suffer from
            birefingence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blu-ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system,
            which helps to prevent piracy and copyright infringment.
          </li>

        </ol>
        <p>
          The table below summarises the main differences between CDs, DVDs and
          Blu-ray.

        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Home video consoles.</li>
          <li>
            Storing and playing back movies (one high-definition movie of two
            hours duration uses up 25GB of memory).
          </li>
          <li>
            PCs can use this technology for data storage or backing up hard
            drives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camcorders can use this media (in a cartidge form) to store movie
            footage.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Very large storage capacity, therfore ideal for storing high-
            definition movies.
          </li>
          <li>Very fast data transfer rate.</li>
          <li>
            The data access speed is also greater than with other optical
            media.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blu-ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system,
            which helpes to prevent piracy and copyright infringement.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Relatively explensive.</li>
          <li>
            Encryption problems (which are used to stop piracy) when used to
            store video
          </li>
          <li>
            There are fewer movie titles on the Blu-ray format, which is
            reducing its impact on the home movie market.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All these optical storage media are used as backup system (for
          photos, music and multimedia files). This also means that CDs and
          DVDs can be used to transfer files between computers. Manufacturers
          often supply their software using CDs and DVDs. When the software is
          supplied in this way, the disk is useally in a read only format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common use of DVD and Blu-ray is the supply of movies or
          games. The memory capacity of CDs isn't big enough to store move
          movies.
        </p>
        <h3>The future of optical media</h3>
        <p>
          In recent times both the CD and DVD are shwing signs of becomeing
          obsolete. many computer systems now come with USB connectores only
          and no DVD or CD drive. The main method of transferring files between
          devices has become flash memory. Many people now store all their
          music in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On hard disk drive systems</li>
          <li>In MP3 format on:</li>
          <ul>
             <li>A computer or tablet</li>
             <li>Their mobile or smartphone</li>
             <li>A portable music player</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Using the 'cloud' to store all their files so they can access their
            music from anywhere in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            By 'streaming' their music from the internet; provided the user had
            an internet connection they can access music through a laptop
            computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other receiving devices.
            (i.e. Spotify, Soundcloud, ect)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is a similar story for movies, where streaming is becoming
          increasingly common. Many television sets are now set up as 'smart'
          televisions - this means it is now possible to simply stream movies
          or television programmes on demand without the need for any DVD or
          Blu-ray players. In effect, the television set has become the central
          computer with a link to the internet using wireless connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Floppy disks met the same fate in the early twenty-first century. How
          often do you see floppy disks? It is very likely that CDs and DVDs
          will meet the same fate and be replaced by one of the systems
          described above or someting emtirely new.
