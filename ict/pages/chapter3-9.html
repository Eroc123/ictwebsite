        <h2>Soild state storage media</h2>
        <h3 id="SSD">Solid state drives (SSD)</h3>
        <p>Solid state drives (SSD)
          Solid state drives (SSD) are rapidly taking over from HDDs. They
          have no moving parts and all data is retrieved at the same rate no
          matter where it is   stored. They don't rely on magnetic
          properties; the most common type of solid state storage devices
          store data by controlling the movement of electrons within NAND*
          chips. The data is stored as Os and Is in millions of tiny
          transistors within the chip. This effectively produces a non-
          volatile rewritable memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          *NAND flash memory is a type of non-volatile storage; a NOR gate
          is a type of logic gate that makes up many electronic circuits.
          NOR gates work in a different way to the NAND gates, but the
          differences are outside the scope of this website. Essentially,
          solid state memories made from NOR gates allow faster read/write
          operations than those made from NAND gates, but the storage
          devices ost much more to manufacture - consequently, most solid
          state storage devices use NAND gate technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the cost implications, the majority pf splid state
          storage devices uses NAND technology. The two usually
          distinguished by the terms flash (uses NAND) and EEPROM (uses NOR).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what are the main advantages of using SSD rather than HDD? The
          main advantages of SSDs are summarised below:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>They are more reliable (no moving parts to go wrong)</li>
          <li>
            They are considerably lighter (which makes them suitable for
            laptops)
          </li>
          <li>
            They don't have to get 'up to speed' before they work properly
          </li>
          <li>They have a lower power consumption</li>
          <li>
            They run much cooler than HDDs (both these points again make
            them very suitable for laptop computers)
          </li>
          <li>Because there are no moving parts, they are very thin.</li>
          <li>Data access is considerably faster than HDD.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The main drawback of SSD is the questionable longevity of the
          technology. Most solid state storage devices are conservatively
          rated at only 20 GB write operations per day over a three-year
          period this is known as SSD endurance. For this reason, SSD
          technology is not used in internet servers, for example, where a
          huge number of write operations take place every day. However,
          this issue is being addressed by a number of manufacturers to
          improve the durability of these solid state systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory sticks/pen drives</h3>
        <p>
          Memory sticks/pen drives can store several gigabytes of data and
          use the solid state technology described above. They are usually
          connected to a computer through the USB port and power to operate
          them is drawn from the host computer. They are extremely small and
          very portable. Most operating systems recognise these storage
          media, which means no additional software is needed to operate
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some expensive software now uses these storage methods (sometimes
          referred to as portable flash drives) as a form of security. They
          plug into the computer using the USB port and are known as
          dongles. The software installed on a computer sends out a request
          (in encrypted form) to the dongle asking for an encrypted
          validation key. Thus a person trying to carry out software piracy
          would have to break the code on the dongle first before they could
          use the software. Some systems go one stage further and have key
          bits of software stored on the dongle in encrypted form. The
          software looks for these pieces of encrypted code to enable it
          to run. This gives an added security benefit to the software.
        </p>
        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Transporting files between computers or used as a backup store.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used as a security device to prevent software piracy (known as a
            dongle).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Very compact and portable media.</li>
          <li>Very robust.</li>
          <li>
            Doesn't need additional software to work on most computers.
          </li>
          <li>They are not affected by magnetic fields.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Can't write-protect the data/files.</li>
          <li>Easy to lose (due to their small physical size).</li>
          <li>
            The user needs to be very careful when removing a memory stick
            from a computer - incorrect removal (for example, while it is
            still doing a read/write operation) will corrupt the data on the
            memory stick, rendering it useless.
          </li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Flash memory cards</h3>
        <p>
          These are a form of electrically erasable programmable read-only
          memory (EEPROM) and are examples of solid state memories.
        </p>
        <p>Uses</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Storing photos on digital cameras.</li>
          <li>Used as mobile phone memory cards.</li>
          <li>Used in MP3 players to sotre music files.</li>
          <li>Used as a backup store in hand-held computer devices.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Advantages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Very compact and can be easily removed and used in another
            device or for transferring photos directly to a computer or
            printer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since they are solid state memories, they are very robust.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disadvabtages</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Expensive per gigabyte of memory when compared to hard drive
            disks.
          </li>
          <li>Have a finite life regarding the number of times they can be read
            from or written to
          </li>
          <li>Have a lower storage capacity than hard disks.</li>
